# HDFS Environment

This holds my Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) configurations I use for my HDFS Forensics Research. The virtual machines have been uploaded and you can find them in the URL below in case you want to use them. The VMs could be found here:
https://archive.org/details/hdfs-cluster

This HDFS Cluster includes 1-Master NameNode and 2-Slave DataNodes. This setup could be used for training with any of the following:
1. How to use Hadoop Distributed File System
2. Do Digital Forensics on Hadoop File Systems
3. Use for Attack Simulation
4. Others, just use your imagination

- Installation: details will be added soon, but it's fairly easy...
- Adding more DataNodes: If you need to use more than 2 DataNodes? details to that will be added soon...

## HDFS Cluster Credentials
