# HDFS Environment

This holds my HDFS configurations I use for my HDFS Forensics Research. The virtual machines have been uploaded and you can find them in the URL below in case you want to use them. You can use them for anything related to HDFS not just digital forensics.

The VMs could be found here:

This HDFS Cluster could be used for training any of the following:
1. How to use Hadoop Distributed File System
2. Do Digital Forensics on Hadoop File Systems
3. Use for Attack Simulation
4. Others, just use your imagination

Good luck...
